# Recipe application built using Vanilla JS

Final Project from The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The project is built using the MVC Architecture, Webpack for bundling and
Babel to convert new JS code into compatible version for older browsers.
Recipes can be uploaded, bookmarked, and searched using an API.
